# Hello-World
The first repository I created.

So finally created a repository (repo) on GitHub & overcame the technical jargon associated with it like: Git, GitHub, repository, fork, etc. So feeling a little bit easy.
Don't know if this project will be useful at all.
Licensed it as GPL3.
& This repo will be initialized with a README file.

Now I'll create a new branch for this commit. & maybe a pull request.
